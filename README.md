## Credits
I used the [Tokyo Night theme](https://github.com/SirHades696/TokyoNight-Ulauncher-Theme) as a foundation for my project. My work is inspired by and references the TokyoNight theme.

The TokyoNight theme, in turn, is inspired by the [Surendrajat project](https://github.com/Surendrajat/SeaOwl-Ulauncher-theme) 

All Ulauncher themes, including Viridian, can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/gornostal/02a232e6e560da7946c053555ced6cce).
