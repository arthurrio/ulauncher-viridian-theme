# Credits
I used the [Tokyo Night theme](https://github.com/SirHades696/TokyoNight-Ulauncher-Theme) as a foundation for my project. My work is inspired by and references the TokyoNight theme.

The TokyoNight theme, in turn, is inspired by the [Surendrajat project](https://github.com/Surendrajat/SeaOwl-Ulauncher-theme)   .
