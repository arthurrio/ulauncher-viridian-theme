# Credits
I utilized the [Tokyo Night theme](https://github.com/SirHades696/TokyoNight-Ulauncher-Theme) as a foundation for my project. 
My work is inspired by and references the TokyoNight theme.
TokyoNight is inspired by [Surendrajat project](https://github.com/Surendrajat/SeaOwl-Ulauncher-theme)
